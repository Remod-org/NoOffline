# NoOffline
EXPERIMENTAL plugin to prevent offline raiding based on privilege owners, members, and friends of those players

This is not for use on PVE servers and/or servers using a PVE plugin.

On every attempt to damage an entity within building privilege, we check for the following:

  1. Any authorized user is currently online
  2. Any friend, clan member, or teammate of an authorized player is online (based on useClans/useFriends/useTeams).

If either of the above are true, damage is allowed.
If all players, members, etc. are offline, damage should be prevented.
